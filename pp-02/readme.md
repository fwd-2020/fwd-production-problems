## ITMD 361, Production Problem 02: HTML Antipatterns, Typographic Grids

For this production problem, you will clean up the different, broken HTML antipatterns in the
`index.html` file in the pp-02/ directory.

There are hints in HTML comments for some mistakes and bad style, but not all. Read every line of
code carefully. Make good use of the W3C HTML Validator and the `htmllint` tool. Remember, too, to
aim for semantic HTML. Valid, linted HTML is not necessarily semantic.

Be sure to make a commit for each fix or group of related fixes. Practice making small,
atomic commits with meaningful commit messages.

Finally, in the `screen.css` file, add the 361 modified, minified reset CSS and set up a basic
typographic grid. Keep your CSS to under 30 lines, not including the reset CSS and comments.
